## üìù DESCRIPTION

The Generative Text Model is an AI-powered application developed using Streamlit and Hugging Face's GPT-2 model. This project enables users to generate coherent, human-like paragraphs by simply entering a text prompt. The model then auto-completes or expands the input into a meaningful passage using natural language generation techniques.

This tool is designed with a user-friendly web interface that allows real-time interaction with the language model. Users can adjust parameters like text length and temperature to influence the creativity and diversity of the generated content.

It serves as a demonstration of language modeling, frontend integration with AI models, and local inference without requiring API keys‚Äîmaking it ideal for educational, content-creation, and prototyping use cases.
